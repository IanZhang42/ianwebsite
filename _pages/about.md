My name is Ian Zhang, I'm a graduate student at the University of Toronto, currently working towards my masters in statistics, which I expect to obtain in June 2026. I recently received my Honours BSc in statistics and mathematics from UofT, from which I graduated with high distinction.

My research interests lie in the more applied realm of statistics, with my interests lying more towards biostatistics, in which I intend to do my PhD. I previosuly conducted research on stochastic models and machine learning under Dr. Michael Kouritzin at the University of Alberta for my two NSERC USRA research terms. We developed a model within the Generative Adversarial Network framework that centers around Markov model to distiguish deepfake data, which outperformed standard GANs, support vector machines, and particle filters in terms of accuracy.
